# Payment Order Orchestrator

An event-driven payment order orchestration service built using **Spring Boot**, **Apache Camel**, **Apache Kafka**, and **MongoDB**.

This project demonstrates how a real-world payment workflow can be modeled as an **asynchronous, state-driven system** with retries, failure handling, and dead-letter queues.
